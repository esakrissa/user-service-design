description: 'Architecture design for a high-scale, Cognito-authenticated User Service'
---

## Overview

This document presents the architecture design for a **User Service** built on the AWS Serverless Framework. The service handles CRUD operations on related **User** and **Email** entities, using **DynamoDB** with a single-table design pattern and **AWS Cognito** for authentication.

## Key Requirements

| Requirement | Solution |
|-------------|----------|
| Authentication | AWS Cognito with JWT tokens |
| Data Storage | DynamoDB single-table design |
| API Layer | API Gateway + Lambda |
| Inter-Service | EventBridge pub/sub |
| Infrastructure | Serverless Framework + Terraform |

## Design Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Type Safety First">
    Every function, handler, and data model is strongly typed. No `any` types. Generics for reusable patterns. Type inference for cleaner consumer code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Single-Table DynamoDB">
    User and Email entities in one table. Designed for access patterns, not normalized relations. Atomic transactions where needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Event-Driven Communication">
    Loose coupling via EventBridge. Services react to events, not direct calls. Dead Letter Queues for failure handling.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Defense in Depth">
    JWT validation at API Gateway. User ID from token claims only. Rate limiting on sensitive operations.
  </Accordion>
